## Bio

> John Bender is the co-creator of Vagrant, a jQuery Mobile contributor, and a recovering polygot. During the day he works full-time on jQuery Mobile at Adobe and otherwise spends his time hacking on open source. John shares his thoughts at http://johnbender.us and as @johnbender on Twitter.

## Abstract

> Progressive Enhancement isn't important on the mobile web because it's all Webkit right? Not so fast. Even among Webkit implementations events, css, and performance vary widely. We'll talk about the darker corners of the mobile web and show how jQuery Mobile can help you build Rails applications that are reliable, accessible, and support more devices.
