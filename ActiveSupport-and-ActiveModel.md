**Presenter:** Bryan Liles

## Abstract

> Have you ever wondered what makes Rails tick? Bryan Liles will cover two of the pillars of the Rails foundation: ActiveSupport and ActiveModel. Together we will discover where some of Railsâ€™ ease and power originates and how make use of it in your projects.

## Notes

* ActiveSupport gives us pluralization and more, makes ruby better
* Use pry instead of IRB
* include ActiveSupport::Benchmarks, Rails uses benchmark for asset times
* include ActiveSupport::Callbacks
