## Abstract

> So you’ve got the basics of Rails down, but you haven’t really done any testing.  Never fear, this course will lead you through everything you need to know to start testing your Rails apps.  All you need to bring is a laptop with Wi-Fi and a browser which isn’t Internet Explorer. All coding will be done through our web application, and there will be plenty of lab assistants to help you if you get stuck along the way.
