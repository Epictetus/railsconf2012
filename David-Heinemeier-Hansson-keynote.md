## Notes

Theme: Progress

### danbernier's notes

The march of progress is painful, and sometimes means you have extra
work to do. (See Ruby 1.9, Bundler, Rails 3, Asset pipeline,
coffeescript.) He implies: progress that's hard to make, is good to
make, and he's proud of that. That's not a terribly sound assumption
to start with, but we'll see where he takes it.

Ah: "Not all forward movement is progress." But: since programming is
more measurable, objective (?) (he uses code length as a measure), we
can be sure we're making real progress.

So: why do people approach some new thing curiously, and become
suspicious? When & why does this switch happen?

"A conservative is a liberal who got mugged:" people start curious,
and some Bad Thing happens to them. "Everyone likes the cutting edge,
until they cut themselves." So people become suspicious out of fear:
"This can never happen again!" (He makes a nice connection to the
TSA.) (Dick Gabriel: "Fear of failure is fear of death.")

Getting old makes you afraid of change, because you have something to
lose. In real life, maybe it takes 30 years, but in tech, it's only
3-5 years.

And then: "Won't somebody please think of the newbies?" We don't want
to make Easy-Bake tech for newbies: they have to learn the real thing,
something valuable.

(This is a pretty bland talk: of course we need real tech, and of
course that can be dangerous, but OTOH, of course we need to encourage
& welcome newbies, and it's a balance between the two, and we need to
find the right dial setting.)

There's an insidious idea that people are (Foo for) Dummies, and that
we can only learn so fast. Learn at your own pace, as fast as you can:
don't let yourself be slowed down. Use cognitive reframing to make
yourself less risk-averse.

DHH cares about tools he can use, so he _builds_ tools he'll use, and
he likes progress. Accept that progress is painful, and it becomes
less painful.
