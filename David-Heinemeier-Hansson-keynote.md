## Notes

### From @benjaminoakes

* Almost 10 years of Ruby
* Constant progress
* Is all progress good?
    * REST (Rails 1.2) was seen as bad by some: Added `routes.rb`
    * Ruby 1.9: we're not there yet
    * Bundler: some people didn't like it
    * Rails 3: harder upgrade
    * Asset pipeline: cool, but took reorganization
    * CoffeeScript: different than JS, but what does it provide?
* In specific cases, "progress" can be hard to say whether "good" or "bad"
* "The old one was better"
    * e.g., OSX Lion
* Not all forward movement isn't always progress
* Measurements can be subjective and objective
    * Does it make the car go faster?
    * e.g., less code
* Skepticism is OK
* What's your default mode?  Curious or suspicious?
    * When does a switch happen?
    * "A conservative is a liberal who got mugged"
    * Lost data, introduced bugs, took a long time to upgrade...
    * "New stuff!"  -> "Ugh, new stuff..."
    * Customer or boss says "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
    * Can turn to overreaction
    * Fear
    * Getting older -> like change less
    * Young -> easier to accept change
    * Not everyone keeps those old ideals (old hippies are rare)
    * Turn into "Mr. Mature"
    * Has something to lose
    * Nice things -> instinctively don't want to lose them (e.g. lots of companies using Rails, etc.)
    * Will suck the life and fun out of you
    * 3-5 years: start growing suspicous
    * Not a whole lot of people go back
    * "Loss aversion is the pillar of conservatism" (as a mental frame of mind)
    * "Won't somebody please think of the newbies?"
    * Want to change it into a easy-bake oven
    * A real oven teaches you real skills, even though it's more dangerous
    * Don't be "mister dummy"; you decide the rate at which you learn this stuff
    * People don't like losing stuff, even technology knowledge
    * You can get out of this (hack your brain)
    * Gambling: pretrend you're a trader and this is an investment
    * Prime your brain to be curious; refocus and reframe
* Great products are made by people who use them
    * You care about tools you can use
    * Don't dumb things down; is that what you want?
    * Still doing Rails because he likes it, even after a decade
* Progress is painful
    * You have to throw some of it out
    * Rails 4 will change things **and** break things
    * "I will not fear change, I will not fight progress"
    * "Stay young, stay curious, stay hippie"

## Discussion

* This kind of seems like Suzuki's "Beginner's Mind" concept @benjaminoakes
* What does this mean for the iPad, OS X Mountain Lion, etc. which are simplified ("made more safe")?  Does that mean we'll have people with fewer programming skills?  @benjaminoakes
* It reminds me of decluttering/minimalizing.  It's hard to get rid of some things, but it can be worth it.  @benjaminoakes
