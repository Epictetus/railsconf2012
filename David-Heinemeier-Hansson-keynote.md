## Notes

* @jamesgary's notes:
  * Everyone likes progress! Universally agreed upon progress, that is.
  * How much do you _really_ like progress?
  * REST wasn't looked as good progress at first.
  * For 1.8ers, 1.9 is a hassle since we have to upgrade everything
  * Bundler was also perceived negatively by many
  * Ditto for asset pipeline, coffeescript
  * These args boil down to "The old one was better"
  * Not all forward movement is progress
  * Can measure some progress, like characters used
  * Skepticism is OK
  * What's bad is when you go from curious to suspicious by default
  * "A conservative is a liberal who got mugged"
    * Someone curious, got burned, now only suspicious
  * Everyone likes the cutting edge until they cut themselves
  * Boss/customer/you say "This can never happen again!"
  * It's a learned reaction
  * Of course, @dhh brings up a TSA reference
  * "No more progress, we tried progress and it didn't work"
  * It's not okay to reject progress because you're scared
  * Growing old -> fear change
    * Old in brain-age, not actual age
  * Most hippies grow up to Mr. Mature, who has something to lose
  * You learn programming, you're invested in what you know and stop
  * Only 3-5 years for coders to go from curious to suspicious
  * Loss aversion is the pillar of conservatism
  * People want to turn tech into Easy-Bake Oven
    * Don't want newbies to hurt themselves on the cutting edge
  * The more things we solve, the more there is to learn
  * There's no speed limit to learning
  * If you read a "For Dummies" book, you'll go at the pace of a dummy and live up to the expections of a dummy
  * 'The standard pace is for chumps'
  * People hate losing more than they like gaining
  * Great products are made by people who use them
  * Progress is painful... but it hurts less if you accept that
  * Rails 4 will change things and break things
  * "I WILL NOT FEAR CHANGE, I WILL NOT FIGHT PROGRESS"
  * Stay young, curuious, hippie
