## Abstract

> Other programming languages have powerful features that are often enviable while working in Ruby: Python’s function decorators, Scala’s partial evaluation, and Haskell’s lazy evaluation, among others. Fortunately, Ruby’s metaprogramming facilities give us the ability to add these features to Ruby ourselves, without the need for the core language to be changed.
>
> This talk will walk through adding simple (yet functional) versions of the previously mentioned features to Ruby, using Ruby, and discuss the dos and don’ts of responsible Ruby metaprogramming.
