## Abstract

> Ever run into a really gnarly data problem and wished you had a do-over? Tired of wrestling with ActiveRecord to model a really complex domain? Looking for a good way to echo state changes to external systems?  Then grab a cup of joe and settle in for a look at event-sourcing your data.
>
> Event-sourced data uses Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) to model your data and exclusively uses events to mutate state on those objects. By serializing the events, the state of your data can be recreated for any point in time, and outside listeners can create specialized purposeful datastores of the data, enabling complex business requirements with fewer hassles.  We'll also touch on other architectural patterns like DCI and CQRS that play well with this idea.
