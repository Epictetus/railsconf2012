## Abstract

> There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. There are over 30,000 RubyGems available on just RubyGems.org, alone. But with so many out there, it must be impossible to find the right one, right? In this talk we’ll learn about some resources which help you find the right gems, as well as how to intelligently decide if a library is right for your project.
