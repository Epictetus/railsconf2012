**Presenter:** Cameron Dutro

## Bio

> Cameron Dutro has worked for Twitter's International Team for about a year and a half, helping build and maintain the Translation Center, Twitter's crowdsourced translation platform.  Although he only started using Ruby and Rails a few years ago, he's a big fan of their extendibility and elegance.  Cameron is also the author of the twitter_cldr gem, an attempt to bring JDK-level internationalization capabilities to the Ruby community.

## Abstract

> Twitter's internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) model doesn't follow traditional methods.  Instead of contracting out to professional translators, Twitter maintains an active community of over 500,000 volunteers who have helped successfully launch Twitter in 28 languages, including right-to-left languages like Hebrew and Arabic.  Learn about some of the technical challenges we face, how to translate a Rails application at scale, and what to do when the i18n gem and po files aren't quite enough.  We'll take a look at the tricky stuff too, like dates, times, lists, plurals, alphabetization, and capitalization using the twitter_cldr gem, and go over internationalization best practices.  Finally, we'll explain how to maintain internationalization of your Javascript alongside your Rails code for an end-to-end solution.
