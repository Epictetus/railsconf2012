> Mikel Lindsaar heads up reInteractive, a Rails development company in Sydney Australia and StillAlive.com a web application monitoring service, he is also the author of the Ruby mail gem, is on the Rails commit team for his work on ActionMailer and has contributed to many open source projects.

## Abstract

> StillAlive.com was born from the 48 hour intense 2010 Rails Rumble and has grown!  Having recently passed our 50,000,000th site result, this talk discusses the real world challenges and optimisations required to take a code base born from the fires of YAGNI to a production system.
>
> This talk isn't about how you can scale from 0 requests to 500 billion requests per microsecond, but give a practical view to some of the performance problems we faced as the application steadily grew from a hack job into a functioning system.
>
> The journey will go through the mistakes we made, challenges faced and real world optimisations discovered, including some tricks we learnt along the way from concurrent index creation to using the ZeroMQ messaging framework with Rails
