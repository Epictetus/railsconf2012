**Presenter:** Brad Gessler

## Bio

> I'm the CTO at Poll Everywhere, the worlds largest mobile survey platform, and I love building stuff. I've been hacking Rails since 1.x, full embraced REST, and haves since extended the concept to make building realtime Rails application easier.

## Abstract

> As more people collaborate on the web with your applications, its not enough to just persist data to the database; it needs to be pushed out to your users web browsers so that they're always working with the freshest data.
>
> In this session, Brad will show how to build a real-time layer on top of an existing Rails application's authorization and resource logic so that you can build on top of the hard work already invested in your Rails application.
>
> Topics that will be discussed include:
>
> - Why I didn't choose Socket.IO
> - Stream application resources into Backbone.js models to keep data fresh
> - Hook into ActiveRecord to push representations of data into a message queue
> - Message queue naming conventions public/private resource streams
> - Exposing message queues to HTTP
> - Securing streams with existing application authorization logic
> - Considerations for streaming in a production environment
