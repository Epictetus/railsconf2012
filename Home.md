Crowd-sourced RailsConf notes!  Working together is better.  :)

The general idea:

* This is an index page.  It will list titles of talks, each of which can have their own page(s).
* Add your name next to talks you're planning to attend
* Internet access generally sucks at events like this.  This wiki [works offline](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/railsconf2012/wiki/_access); it's just a `git` repo full of Markdown files.
