Crowd-sourced RailsConf notes!  Working together is better.  :)

## The General Idea

* Internet access generally sucks at events like this.  This wiki [works offline](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki/_access); it's just a `git` repo full of Markdown files.
* There's no reason to fork (actually, GitHub doesn't handle forking wikis all that well); just [clone](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki/_access), make your changes, commit, and push like normal.
* This is an index page.  It has a list of talks, each of which can have their own page(s).
* You can add your name next to talks you're planning to attend

## Software

Recommended plugins and such.  Others are welcome

* `gollum`
    * [gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum): what GitHub made for `git`-based wikis.  (See also: [Fix `undefined method 'new' for Redcarpet:Module`](https://github.com/github/gollum/pull/271))
* `vim`
    * [vim-markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown): syntax, etc
    * [wikilink](https://github.com/mmai/wikilink): wiki navigation in `vim`
